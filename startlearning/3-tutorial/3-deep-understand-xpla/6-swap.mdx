# Design Swap System

The swap system facilitates easy token exchanges, allowing for the seamless swapping of CW20 tokens(<ACADEMYTKN />) for $XPLA(<TESTNETXPLA />), as well as for other CW20 tokens!

🙀 Can't wait to try out the swap feature? 
You can do so at [Web3 Gaming Ops](/ops)! 
In this lesson, we'll delve into the mechanics of how swapping is structured between CW20 tokens(<ACADEMYTKN />) and $XPLA(<TESTNETXPLA />). 
But first, let's refresh our understanding of what a [Pair](https://explorer.xpla.io/testnet/address/xpla1j4kgjl6h4rt96uddtzdxdu39h0mhn4vrtydufdrk4uxxnrpsnw2qug2yx2) is and how it forms the foundation of the swap feature.

<Details summary="What is Pair?">
Pair is a smart contract that stores coins and tokens for swap. 
Let's assume that Alice requests a Swap in the Pair contract, exchanging her coin A for coin B. 
In this process, the Pair contract will give Alice B coin from its reserves in exchange for her A coin. 
This is how a Swap is carried out, and it's important to note that Pair is essential for this operation.

</Details>

:::info

In this lesson, we are using the [Dezswap Contract](https://github.com/dezswap) to create the Pair.
This contract employs the [Automated Market-Maker (AMM) protocol](https://docs.dezswap.io/docs/introduction/mechanism/). 
For more detailed information, please refer to the [Dezswap Docs](https://docs.dezswap.io/). 
You are welcome to develop a new contract to create your own Pair, or you can use Dezswap as demonstrated in the example.

The Swap feature is designed in the following steps.

0. [Prepare CW20 Tokens](/startlearning/tutorial/deep-understand-xpla/swap#make-cw20)

1. [Create Pair](/startlearning/tutorial/deep-understand-xpla/swap#create-swap-pool)

2. [Increase Allowance](/startlearning/tutorial/deep-understand-xpla/swap#increase-allowance)

3. [Provide Liquidity](/startlearning/tutorial/deep-understand-xpla/swap#provide-liquidity)

4. [Execute Swap](/startlearning/tutorial/deep-understand-xpla/swap#execute-swap)

### 0. Prepare CW20 Tokens {#make-cw20}

For the example, we have created a CW20 token named `ACAD`. The contract address for this token is [xpla13mxqv7yqedcpm67fw7yz7p4s32rlsdkaae3ecmc0tram72ewefts2uu3ax](https://explorer.xpla.io/testnet/address/xpla13mxqv7yqedcpm67fw7yz7p4s32rlsdkaae3ecmc0tram72ewefts2uu3ax).

Below is the JavaScript code used to create the CW20 token. This code is similar to the one used in [Issue and Transfer Tokens (CW20) using JavaScript](/startlearning/tutorial/make-cw20/make-cw20-with-js), with modifications only to the name and symbol:

```js {17,18}
const { LCDClient, MnemonicKey, MsgInstantiateContract } = require("@xpla/xpla.js");

const lcd = new LCDClient({
	chainID: 'cube_47-5',
	URL: 'https://cube-lcd.xpla.dev'
});

const main = async () => {
	const mk = new MnemonicKey({
		mnemonic: 'myth snow ski simple century dad gun dolphin sail lawsuit fringe image toast betray frown keep harbor flash table prevent isolate panic tag vehicle' // 여러분의 니모닉 단어로 바꿔주세요.
	})

	const wallet = lcd.wallet(mk);
	const myWalletAddress = wallet.key.accAddress;

	const init_msg = {
		name: "CW20 Contract for Swap Tutorial", 
		symbol: "ACAD", 
		decimals: 6,
		initial_balances: [{ address: myWalletAddress, amount: "2000000000000000" }], 
		mint: { 
			minter: myWalletAddress
		}
	};

	const instantiate = new MsgInstantiateContract(
		myWalletAddress, 
		myWalletAddress, 
		1,
		init_msg,
		{},
		'Example for Swap',
	);

	const signedTx = await lcd.wallet(mk).createAndSignTx({ 
		msgs: [instantiate]
	});

	const txResult = await lcd.tx.broadcastSync(signedTx);
	console.log(txResult.txhash);
}
main()
```

### 1. Create Pair {#create-swap-pool}

For the example, we will use Dezswap's [dezswap_factory contract](https://github.com/dezswap/dezswap-contracts/tree/main/contracts/dezswap_factory) to create a Pair. 
Factory contract performs the function of managing token Pair.
The contract address for dezswap_factory is `xpla1j33xdql0h4kpgj2mhggy4vutw655u90z7nyj4afhxgj4v5urtadq44e3vd` on the Mainnet and `xpla1j4kgjl6h4rt96uddtzdxdu39h0mhn4vrtydufdrk4uxxnrpsnw2qug2yx2` on the Testnet.

The JavaScript code to Execute the [create_pair function](https://github.com/dezswap/dezswap-contracts/tree/main/contracts/dezswap_factory#create_pair) of the dezswap_factory contract is as follows:

```js {16,27,35}
const { LCDClient, MnemonicKey, MsgExecuteContract } = require("@xpla/xpla.js");

const lcd = new LCDClient({
	chainID: 'cube_47-5',
	URL: 'https://cube-lcd.xpla.dev'
});

const main = async () => {
	const mk = new MnemonicKey({
		mnemonic: 'myth snow ski simple century dad gun dolphin sail lawsuit fringe image toast betray frown keep harbor flash table prevent isolate panic tag vehicle'
	})

	const wallet = lcd.wallet(mk);
	const myWalletAddress = wallet.key.accAddress;

	const testnet_dezswap_factory = "xpla1j4kgjl6h4rt96uddtzdxdu39h0mhn4vrtydufdrk4uxxnrpsnw2qug2yx2";

	const createPairMsg = new MsgExecuteContract(
		myWalletAddress,
		testnet_dezswap_factory,
		{
			"create_pair": {
				"assets": [
					{
						"info": {
							"native_token": {
								"denom": "axpla"
							}
						},
						"amount": "0"
					},
					{
						"info": {
							"token": {
								"contract_addr": "xpla13mxqv7yqedcpm67fw7yz7p4s32rlsdkaae3ecmc0tram72ewefts2uu3ax" // Your Contract Address
							}
						},
						"amount": "0"
					}
				]
			}
		}
	);

	const signedTx = await lcd.wallet(mk).createAndSignTx({
		msgs: [createPairMsg]
	});

	const txResult = await lcd.tx.broadcastSync(signedTx);
	console.log(txResult.txhash);
}
main()
```

After executing the above code, we created a Pair on the Testnet! 
The transaction can be found on the [XPLA Explorer](https://explorer.xpla.io/testnet/tx/1b6f0d98e79b3232cb2f8c9df6b46f4859b70820facf063a66710f90c158b642#Messages). 
When you executing this code, remember to fill in the `contract_addr` field with the address of the CW20 token contract you created.

Upon reviewing the [Event Logs](https://explorer.xpla.io/testnet/tx/1B6F0D98E79B3232CB2F8C9DF6B46F4859B70820FACF063A66710F90C158B642#EventLogs), you can see that new contracts have been instantiated. 
Among these, the contract with `code_id` 369 is the [dezswap_pair Contract](https://github.com/dezswap/dezswap-contracts/tree/main/contracts/dezswap_pair), and the one with code_id 110 is the [dezswap_token Contract](https://github.com/dezswap/dezswap-contracts/tree/main/contracts/dezswap_token) (note that these `code_ids` are based on Testnet, and the `code_ids` on Mainnet will be different). 
In this example, the dezswap_pair Contract is at [xpla1hzmcz38u28g6duy4gmur705e8qrdq7uvzsue4d8hdvclxz79uppsw3hfns](https://explorer.xpla.io/testnet/address/xpla1hzmcz38u28g6duy4gmur705e8qrdq7uvzsue4d8hdvclxz79uppsw3hfns#InitMsg), and the dezswap_token Contract is at [xpla1ntr800lgjg59d79tr9c78kxjv9v9wm04hjdyq945663juf23hvqq0xy057](https://explorer.xpla.io/testnet/address/xpla1ntr800lgjg59d79tr9c78kxjv9v9wm04hjdyq945663juf23hvqq0xy057#InitMsg).

<Details summary="How can I go about creating a Pair for exchanging between CW20 tokens?">

In the code mentioned earlier, you can define the createPairMsg variable as follows:

```js {7-14}
const createPairMsg = new MsgExecuteContract(
	myWalletAddress,
	testnet_dezswap_factory,
	{
		"create_pair": {
			"assets": [
				{
					"info": {
						"token": {
							"contract_addr": "xpla13mxqv7yqedcpm67fw7yz7p4s32rlsdkaae3ecmc0tram72ewefts2uu3ax" // Your Contract Address1
						}
					},
					"amount": "0"
				},
				{
					"info": {
						"token": {
							"contract_addr": "xpla13mxqv7yqedcpm67fw7yz7p4s32rlsdkaae3ecmc0tram72ewefts2uu3ax" // Your Contract Address2
						}
					},
					"amount": "0"
				}
			]
		}
	}
);
```

</Details>

### 2. Increase Allowance {#increase-allowance}

First, you need to supply CW20 tokens and $XPLA to the dezswap_pair Contract in the [3. Provide Liquidity step](/startlearning/tutorial/deep-understand-xpla/swap#provide-liquidity).
Here, [the dezswap_pair Contract executes the TransferFrom function of the CW20 token](https://github.com/dezswap/dezswap-contracts/blob/main/contracts/dezswap_pair/src/contract.rs#L366) to retrieve the CW20 tokens from the wallet providing them. 
To ensure a smooth liquidity provision, you must allow the dezswap_pair contract to take the CW20 tokens. 
Therefore, we will execute the [IncreaseAllowance](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/blob/main/packages/cw20/README.md#messages-1) function of the CW20 token Contract.

```js {16,23,24}
const { LCDClient, MnemonicKey, MsgExecuteContract } = require("@xpla/xpla.js");

const lcd = new LCDClient({
	chainID: 'cube_47-5',
	URL: 'https://cube-lcd.xpla.dev'
});

const main = async () => {
	const mk = new MnemonicKey({
		mnemonic: 'myth snow ski simple century dad gun dolphin sail lawsuit fringe image toast betray frown keep harbor flash table prevent isolate panic tag vehicle'
	})

	const wallet = lcd.wallet(mk);
	const myWalletAddress = wallet.key.accAddress;

	const cw20_contract_address = "xpla13mxqv7yqedcpm67fw7yz7p4s32rlsdkaae3ecmc0tram72ewefts2uu3ax"; // Your CW20 Contract Address

	const increaseAllowanceMsg = new MsgExecuteContract(
		myWalletAddress,
		cw20_contract_address,
		{
			"increase_allowance": {
			  "amount": "10000000000",
			  "spender": "xpla1hzmcz38u28g6duy4gmur705e8qrdq7uvzsue4d8hdvclxz79uppsw3hfns" // dezswap_pair Contract Address
			}
		  }
	);

	const signedTx = await lcd.wallet(mk).createAndSignTx({
		msgs: [increaseAllowanceMsg]
	});

	const txResult = await lcd.tx.broadcastSync(signedTx);
	console.log(txResult.txhash);
}
main()
```

The result of the above can be checked on the [XPLA Explorer](https://explorer.xpla.io/testnet/tx/0f19ff4c0d8592addd567c5eb7ae63d0869b6b2f8007b42a49b765bcca6189b7#Messages). 
When you run it, you need to enter the address of your CW20 token contract into the `cw20_contract_address` variable and the address of the dezswap_pair contract you created into the `spender` field. 
In the example, we set the amount value to `10000000000`. 
Since the decimals value of the `ACAD` CW20 token is 6, this allows for the provision of up to 10,000 `ACAD` tokens.

### 3. Provide Liquidity {#provide-liquidity}

To provide liquidity to the Pair created in step 1, we will execute the [provide_liquidity function](https://github.com/dezswap/dezswap-contracts/tree/main/contracts/dezswap_pair#request-format) of the dezswap_pair Contract.

```js {16,30,38,43,44,45}
const { LCDClient, MnemonicKey, MsgExecuteContract, Coin } = require("@xpla/xpla.js");

const lcd = new LCDClient({
	chainID: 'cube_47-5',
	URL: 'https://cube-lcd.xpla.dev'
});

const main = async () => {
	const mk = new MnemonicKey({
		mnemonic: 'myth snow ski simple century dad gun dolphin sail lawsuit fringe image toast betray frown keep harbor flash table prevent isolate panic tag vehicle'
	})

	const wallet = lcd.wallet(mk);
	const myWalletAddress = wallet.key.accAddress;

	const dezswap_pair_contract_address = "xpla1hzmcz38u28g6duy4gmur705e8qrdq7uvzsue4d8hdvclxz79uppsw3hfns"; // dezswap_pair Contract Address

	const provideLiquidityMsg = new MsgExecuteContract(
		myWalletAddress,
		dezswap_pair_contract_address,
		{
			"provide_liquidity": {
				"assets": [
					{
						"info": {
							"native_token": {
								"denom": "axpla"
							}
						},
						"amount": "10000000000000000000"
					},
					{
						"info": {
							"token": {
								"contract_addr": "xpla13mxqv7yqedcpm67fw7yz7p4s32rlsdkaae3ecmc0tram72ewefts2uu3ax" // Your Contract Address
							}
						},
						"amount": "10000000000"
					}
				]
			}
		},
		[new Coin(
			"axpla",
			"10000000000000000000"
		)],
	);

	const signedTx = await lcd.wallet(mk).createAndSignTx({
		msgs: [provideLiquidityMsg],
	});

	const txResult = await lcd.tx.broadcastSync(signedTx);
	console.log(txResult.txhash);
}
main()
```

You can check the outcome of running this code on the [XPLA Explorer](https://explorer.xpla.io/testnet/tx/2e5c9c1e142599784df050437e3f97ca84d0dc082bd86d3ba82be6b3b5402e08#Messages). 
For both the XPLA and CW20 token, we specified the quantities we wanted to supply in the amount field. 
As a result, we provided a total of 10 XPLA and 10,000 `ACAD`.

When creating the provideLiquidityMsg variable, it's important to note a key difference from previous steps: you need to input the axpla value as the last parameter. 
This enables the simultaneous supply of XPLA to the dezswap_pair Contract at the time of transaction execution. 
As for the CW20 token provision, it was retrieved by the dezswap_pair Contract, as explored in the [2. Increase allowance](/startlearning/tutorial/deep-understand-xpla/swap#increase-allowance) stage.

### 4. Execute Swap {#execute-swap}

Now let's proceed with a Swap. In this example, we will exchange 1 `ACAD` token for XPLA. The format for the Contract Execute message was referenced from the [dezswap GitHub](https://github.com/dezswap/dezswap-contracts/tree/main/contracts/dezswap_pair#swap).

```js {16,23}
const { LCDClient, MnemonicKey, MsgExecuteContract } = require("@xpla/xpla.js");

const lcd = new LCDClient({
	chainID: 'cube_47-5',
	URL: 'https://cube-lcd.xpla.dev'
});

const main = async () => {
	const mk = new MnemonicKey({
		mnemonic: 'myth snow ski simple century dad gun dolphin sail lawsuit fringe image toast betray frown keep harbor flash table prevent isolate panic tag vehicle'
	})

	const wallet = lcd.wallet(mk);
	const myWalletAddress = wallet.key.accAddress;

	const token_contract_address = "xpla13mxqv7yqedcpm67fw7yz7p4s32rlsdkaae3ecmc0tram72ewefts2uu3ax"; // Your Contract Address
	
	const swapMsg = new MsgExecuteContract(
		myWalletAddress,
		token_contract_address,
		{
			"send": {
				"contract": "xpla1hzmcz38u28g6duy4gmur705e8qrdq7uvzsue4d8hdvclxz79uppsw3hfns", // dezswap_pair Contract Address
				"amount": "1000000",
				"msg": btoa(JSON.stringify({
					"swap": {
						// "belief_price": Option<Decimal>,
						// "max_spread": Option<Decimal>,
						// "to": Option<HumanAddr>
					}
				}))
			}
		}
	);

	const signedTx = await lcd.wallet(mk).createAndSignTx({
		msgs: [swapMsg],
	});

	const txResult = await lcd.tx.broadcastSync(signedTx);
	console.log(txResult.txhash);
}
main()
```

You can verify the results of running the above code on the [XPLA Explorer](https://explorer.xpla.io/testnet/tx/02f8495b6df3526dc5ce9d149129788ae1683d89167d14b5336e092e403bc31c#TokenTransfers). 
You need to input the CW20 contract address in the `token_contract_address` variable and the dezswap_pair contract address in the `contract` field within the msg. 
It's important to note that the contract to be executed differs when exchanging XPLA for CW20 tokens. 
For more details, please refer to the [dezswap GitHub](https://github.com/dezswap/dezswap-contracts/tree/main/contracts/dezswap_pair#swap).


Now, you might wonder why, after putting in 1 `ACAD` token, you received about 0.0001 XPLA. 
This is because, during the [3. Provide Liquidity](/startlearning/tutorial/deep-understand-xpla/swap#provide-liquidity) stage, a total of 10 XPLA and 10,000 ACAD were supplied to the Pair. 
Therefore, the product of the number of tokens in the Pair should always be maintained at 10 × 10,000 = 100,000([CPMM](https://docs.dezswap.io/docs/introduction/mechanism/)). 
When 1 `ACAD` token is added, the product of the token numbers in the Pair should be (10 - XPLA_out) × (10,000 + 1) = 100,000. 

Also, with dezswap, there's a [LP Commission of 0.3% given to the liquidity provider](https://docs.dezswap.io/docs/introduction/trading-fees/)during a swap. 
After accounting for this 0.3% fee, you end up receiving about 0.0001 XPLA. 
For a more detailed explanation, you can consult the [dezswap Docs](https://docs.dezswap.io/docs/introduction/mechanism/).

<Details summary="How do I exchange XPLA for CW20 tokens?">

In the code above, you can enter the swapMsg as follows:

```js {3,19-22}
const swapMsg = new MsgExecuteContract(
	myWalletAddress,
	dezswap_pair_contract_address,
	{
		"swap": {
			"offer_asset": {
				"info": {
					"native_token": {
						"denom": "axpla"
					}
				},
				"amount": "1000000000000000000"
			},
			//"belief_price": Option<Decimal>,
			//"max_spread": Option<Decimal>,
			//"to": Option<HumanAddr>
		}
	},
	[new Coin(
		"axpla",
		"1000000000000000000"
	)],
);
```

When exchanging CW20 tokens for XPLA, you executed the CW20 token contract. 
However, to exchange XPLA for CW20 tokens, you must execute the <u>dezswap_pair_contract_address</u>. Additionally, you need to include the amount of XPLA you want to swap as a contract parameter, using the `new Coin("axpla", "..")` format.

</Details>

## Conclusion

We have explored how to develop a Swap feature using the Dezswap contract. Now, try connecting the CW20 token from your developed game with XPLA through the Swap contract.
