# Getting Testnet $XPLA Coins

import VaultImgCard from "@site/src/components/VaultImgCard";
import BrowserWindow from '@site/src/components/BrowserWindow';

To send transactions and deploy contracts on the XPLA blockchain, you'll need to pay fees in $XPLA coins, the native token on the XPLA Chain. However, It can be quite expensive to cover these fees each time for development or testing. (We feel you)

For this reason, testnets exist! On a testnet, anyone can freely obtain $XPLA coins to use for experimentation. Let's dive right in and get started.

:::caution

A testnet serves as an environment for testing and advancing the XPLA blockchain. The $XPLA coins within the testnet hold no actual value. Therefore, utilizing a testnet for commercial purposes isn't advisable, as test environments can change or even vanish, much like Ethereum's Ropsten testnet, for instance.

:::tip

The mainnet and testnet even have different names (chainIDs)! The chainID for the mainnet is `dimension_37-1`, while the testnet's chainID is `cube_47-5`. Some of you may have already caught onto this in the [previous step](/startlearning/settings/create-wallet/create-wallet-with-js#runjs).

## Receiving $XPLA Coins from the Faucet

The place to obtain testnet $XPLA coins is called Faucet.

You can acquire $XPLA coins through the following steps:

1. Access the [Faucet website](https://faucet.xpla.io/).

2. Enter your wallet address in the Faucet and click the `Send me tokens` button. For this tutorial, we'll be using the test wallet address `xpla1f6hcc3hpxyg8rst9d5sg393e5jaj7453t0xmz8`.

<BrowserWindow url="https://faucet.xpla.io/" bodyStyle={{padding: 0}}>
<div className="flex justify-center" style={{backgroundColor : 'hsl(240, 20%, 97%)', position : 'relative'}}>
    <div style={{position : 'absolute', backgroundColor : '#031435', height : '29px', width : '100%', top : 0, zIndex : 0}} />
    <VaultImgCard style={{zIndex : 1}} imgSrc="/img/2-settings/1-create-wallet/faucet-example.png" />
</div>
</BrowserWindow>

3. If you check your Vault, you'll notice that you've acquired 100 XPLA! If you can't see what I'm seeing, hit the gear icon on the top right and switch the network to testnet.

<BrowserWindow url="google.com" bodyStyle={{padding: "0px 0px 16px 0px", position : 'relative'}}>
    <div className="flex justify-center" style={{width : '100%', height : '100%', top : 0, zIndex : 0, position: 'absolute' }}>
        <img  style={{height : '100%'}} src="/img/2-settings/1-create-wallet/google.png" />
    </div>
<div className="flex justify-end" style={{zIndex : 1,position:'relative'}}>
    <VaultImgCard imgSrc="/img/2-settings/1-create-wallet/get-token.png" />
</div>
</BrowserWindow>

Have you successfully received the testnet coins? In the [next step](/startlearning/settings/create-testnet-transaction/send-tx), we'll utilize the received $XPLA to leave a mark in the blockchain by storing data.
